						So... I'm about to begin my second project. This is based on the JS/JQuery, Sass, data visualisation and incorporation of API's
						into the webpage. At the moment I'm not 100% sure what to do....there are a few of options to choose from: the first is based 
						on incorporation of API's into a holiday destination website; the second is create a simple single player memory game; the third 
						is to build a data dashboard to visualize a chosen dataset. Alternatively, you can create your own project based on similar criteria
						to those already defined. At the moment I'm more inclined to doing the data dashboard project as I felt that I didn't understand that
						section of the course as well as I could have and this would force me to understand the material better!

						Hi, thank you for visiting my blog. My name is Chris. I'm from the Glasgow area of the U.K. and
						I have two beautiful daughters (6 years old and 3 years old) who are with me in the picture....
						it was taken at Halloween: they don't always dress like that.
						</br>
						</br>
						I've worked in engineering for the past 4 years, mainly in Aerospace. Currently, 
						I'm a Product Engineer in the Automotive industry. I came into engineering with the aim of designing and producing 
						things I could be proud of but, unfortunately, the work is mundane and unsatisfying.
						</br>
						</br> 
						Having become quite disillusioned with the engineering industry: I have decided that it is time for a career change and that a career in software development is for me. 
						I'm of the belief that a career in this industry will allow me the independence to produce high quality work that I can be proud of and ultimately give me freedom to work
						on projects that interest me. Having made this decision I have began the Full Stack Developer course run by Code Institute. Unlike some of the other students taking this course: 
						I do have a little bit of a background in software development.	This was mainly in the form of using tools like MATLAB/Simulink for engineering design but the underlying principles are similar.
						</br>
						</br>
						My short term aim is to learn how to develop software to a level where I can begin a career in the industry. My long term aim is to become a self-employed contractor and only work on projects that interest me.
						The aim of this blog is to chart my progress through the course and my subsequent career and provide a reference for other people who are planning on starting a career in software development and
						to show them that it is indeed possible to change your career whilst working in another industry.
